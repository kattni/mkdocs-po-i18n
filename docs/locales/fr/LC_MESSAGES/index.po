"MkDocs PO I18n is a tool designed to build translations of MkDocs "
"documentation. Generated PO template (POT) files, created from the primary "
"language Markdown documentation files, are used to generate PO files for "
"each specified langauge. The PO translation files are used to build the "
"translated site for each language. This tool is compatible with using "
"Weblate for the translation workflow, and Read the Docs for hosting the "
"original and translated documentation."
